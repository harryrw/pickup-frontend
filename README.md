## Description

The PickUp app is a simple application used to help you create and find local basketball games. This app is designed for people who want to play basketball, but might not have a regular group of people to play with. You can search for local games, and express your interest in joining the game. PickUp also provides users with information for any locally registered courts, along with the ability to register a court of their own. Users can filter registered courts by state.  
  
The following README is for both the front-end and back-end portions of the full-stack application. Links to the front-end and back-end repositories are provided at the top of the README file.

## Project Management Methodology

For the current project we employed an Agile project management methodology. Entering into this project, we placed an emphasis on keeping the project organised and structured. Having never completed a full-stack application before, we wanted to ensure that the project managament methodology we choose was flexible, allowing us to adjust and adapt the plan when necessary.  
  
In planning, we initially broke down the application into smaller components and features, each with their own trello card. each component had a checklist that broke down the necessary (and sometimes not necessary) elements of the component. These components were used as a guide to help execute the coding of the project. In completing the project, if we identified that certain elements of the component were absent, or found potential improvements, we would discuss and then adjust the card as necessary.
  
We conducted daily morning meetings consisting of:

* Sprint planning (task delegation)
* Check-ins
* Code reviews
* Alterations to any cards on the trello board

Once our sprint(s) had been decided the card was moved to the sprint board. This would then make the card(s) in the sprint board our priority focus, and once completed the card was then moved to the 'quality assurance' board - for review the next meeting. Some tasks were not entirely completed, or in some situations put on hold, in favour of another sprint. These tasks were added to the 'in progress' board.

## Project Task Delegation

Task delegation was determined and discussed in our morning meetings. Being a group of two people, and both with an interest on all aspects of a full-stack application, we decided to keep the task delegation relatively flexible and adaptive. On initialising the application we each set up either the front-end (Harry) or back-end (Zac), with Harry expressing more of an interest in front-end work and Zac in the back-end work. As the project progressed, we both needed to work on all aspects of the project, but many tasks were delegated in accordance with the initial division of work. Harry worked on many of the front-end components and styling, whilst making back-end changes when necessary. Zac developed the back-end API, and designed a few front-end components. Several life events out of our control (i.e. job interviews and health) affected our task delegation, with the group member not affected by any life events taking charge of the current sprint. Tasks were assigned in Trello, but with a lot flexibliity in the delegation of tasks there was quite a bit of overlap. For any tasks that either of us were struggling with, we would either meet in person, or screen share on discord to troubleshoot the issue.
